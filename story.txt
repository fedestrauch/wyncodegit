Agile User Story

A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

Using the ATM example below write a similarly formatted user story as a customer of a car rental company. Include scenarios.

Example user story:
As an: Account Holder
I want to: withdraw cash from at ATM
So that: I can get money when the bank is closed

Example scenarios:
- The account has sufficient funds
- The account has insufficient funds
- The card has been disabled
